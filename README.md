## Decentralized Application (Web 3.0)

A simple webpage with buttons that can interact with smart contract functions.

Various stages of the application:
1) Installed MetaMask with seed words and created a wallet for various transactions. Requested some Ropsten Tesnet Ether from a faucet loaded into your Metamask Wallet. Installed 'lite-server' as the HTTP Server.
2) Created a basic html web page (in VS Code).
3) Created Solidity Smart Contract in Remix IDE.
4) Connect the webpage with the smart contracts using Ethersjs (inside script).
